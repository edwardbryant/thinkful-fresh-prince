<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>

<p>From western Philadelphia I hail<br>where in my youth I'd play upon the green<br>'til - rue the day! - I found myself assail'd<br>by ruffians contemptible and mean.<br><br>Although the spat was trivial and brief,<br>it wounded my dear mother deep within;<br>and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,<br>she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.<br><br>When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,<br>I came upon a coachman most unique;<br>and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,<br>despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.<br><br>I survey all the land with princely mien in fair Bel-Air,<br>where I do lay my scene.</p>
